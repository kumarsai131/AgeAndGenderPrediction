# Classification and Prediction of Gender and Age using CNN

###### ABSTRACT

The Classification & Prediction of Gender and Age is a technique used for prediction of age and
the gender of a person from an image uploaded to the project framework. Some applications of
this project are Identity Verification, Biometrics, Video Surveillance, Advertisement, Movie
recommendation, Item recommendation, Songs recommendation etc. In this project I am using
Convolution Neural Networks along with the API Keras and Ktrain for the model training and
prediction. I am also using Django, The frontend python framework for creating the web
application so this project can be used from anywhere in the internet. I have also uploaded all the
weights and the architecture of the models into the web server so in the future anyone can be able
to use the project to improve the accuracy of it.
